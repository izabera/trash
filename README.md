Trash
=====

Trash is a trash bin utility.  If you use it instead of your regular rm,
your files will be moved to ~/.trash for later use.
Multiple files can be trashed or restored with a single command.

OPTION may be one of the following:

  -h|--help                 print this help and exit
  -l|--list                 list all files in your trash bin
  -r|--restore NUMBER ...   restore files in their original path
  -c|--clean                remove everything
  -t|--trash FILE ...       trash files (default)
